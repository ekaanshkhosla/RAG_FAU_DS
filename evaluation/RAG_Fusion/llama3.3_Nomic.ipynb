       " 'Based on the provided context, it appears that you are allowed to choose modules from any of the application subjects and combine them. However, the specific rules regarding completing a major module requirement with a 2.5 ECTS or 5 ECTS subject are not explicitly stated.\\n\\nBut according to the general rules mentioned in the context, you can transfer ECTS for a module from one module group to another by sending an email to the examination office. Also, it is mentioned that you can use your working experience as a technical qualification if you work longer than 4 weeks in a company and if your tasks are related to Data Science.\\n\\nRegarding your specific question, since you only need 2.5 ECTS to complete your major module requirements, it is likely that you can fulfill this requirement by taking a 2.5 ECTS subject. However, it is also possible to consider enrolling in a 5 ECTS subject, as long as you can transfer the excess ECTS to another module group or use them to fulfill another requirement.\\n\\nTo ensure that you complete your credits in a timely and effective manner, I would recommend the following:\\n\\n1. Check the module catalog to see if there are any 2.5 ECTS subjects available that can help you fulfill your major module requirements.\\n2. If you cannot find a 2.5 ECTS subject, consider enrolling in a 5 ECTS subject and then transfer the excess ECTS to another module group.\\n3. Send an email to the examination office to confirm that your plan is acceptable and to get their approval for any necessary transfers.\\n4. Make sure to discuss your plan with your mentor to ensure that you are meeting all the requirements for your major module.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to complete your major module requirements in a timely and effective manner.']"
