    "    \"To start your Master’s thesis, you need an official supervisor from FAU. The person must be a professor or at least have completed a habilitation ('Dr. habil.' or 'PD') and must be a member of one of the following departments: Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering (AIBE). Professors who are secondary members in these departments can also supervise. Your official supervisor is also the first examiner of your thesis and should propose a second examiner from any department at FAU. Additional guidance from PhD students is possible, but they cannot be official supervisors.\",\n",
    "    \"It is highly recommended that you complete 75 ECTS of your study curriculum before choosing a Master’s seminar topic. You should complete all core modules and major modules first. Your thesis topic should ideally align with your specialization and Master’s seminar, following §54 of the examination regulations ('Mentoring') and your individual study agreement.\",\n",
    "    \"A completed B.Sc. degree in Mathematics, Industrial Mathematics, Mathematical Economy, Computer Science, Data Science, or Physics from FAU or an equivalent domestic or international degree that aligns with the competence profile of the program. A GPA of 2.5 or better (German grading system) is required. Applicants with a GPA between 2.6 and 2.8 will be invited for an online interview assessing their knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, algorithms, and data structures. English proficiency at B2 CEFR or proof of English-taught education is required.\",\n",

The enrollment fee should be transferred in advance, especially if transferring from abroad (recommended two weeks before). After enrollment, you gain access to online teaching resources and platforms like StudOn and Campo.\",\n",
    "    \"No, but solid German knowledge (B1) is recommended for daily life, internships, and working student jobs. However, a certificate is not required for the application.\",\n",

The letter of admission from winter semester 2021/22 will no longer be recognized. Your application will be completely re-examined and re-evaluated, so uploading the previous offer letter makes no difference.\",\n",

    "    \"To complete your degree, you need 120 ECTS, including all core, major, minor, application modules, seminar, and thesis. If you complete 120 ECTS by September 2024 and your supervisor submits your thesis grade before the end of September, you will be deregistered at the end of the summer semester 2024. If you complete it in October 2024, you will be deregistered at the end of the winter semester 2024/25. You can also choose to de-register earlier if desired.\",\n",

You can take subjects at your comfort, but 30 ECTS per semester is recommended (1 ECTS = 1 hour of study). 3) Yes, you can work part-time. A student can work up to 20 hours per week with a part-time student job.\",\n",
