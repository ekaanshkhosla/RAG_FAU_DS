The person must be a professor or at least have completed a habilitation ('Dr. habil.' or 'PD') and must be a member of one of the following departments: Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering (AIBE). Professors who are secondary members in these departments can also supervise. Your official supervisor is also the first examiner of your thesis and should propose a second examiner from any department at FAU. Additional guidance from PhD students is possible, but they cannot be official supervisors.\",\n",

If you complete 120 ECTS by September 2024 and your supervisor submits your thesis grade before the end of September, you will be deregistered at the end of the summer semester 2024.
