If the module is an elective mandatory module (core elective module in Campo), you can choose another module and continue your studies. If the module is a core module of your study course (Mathematics of Learning, Selected Topics of Mathematics of Learning, or Deep Learning), you cannot continue your studies in this program at FAU.\",\n",
    "    \"To start your Master’s thesis, you need an official supervisor from FAU. The person must be a professor or at least have completed a habilitation ('Dr. habil.' or 'PD') and must be a member of one of the following departments: Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering (AIBE). Professors who are secondary members in these departments can also supervise. Your official supervisor is also the first examiner of your thesis and should propose a second examiner from any department at FAU. Additional guidance from PhD students is possible, but they cannot be official supervisors.\",\n",
    "    \"It is highly recommended that you complete 75 ECTS of your study curriculum before choosing a Master’s seminar topic. You should complete all core modules and major modules first. Your thesis topic should ideally align with your specialization and Master’s seminar, following §54 of the examination regulations ('Mentoring') and your individual study agreement.\",\n",
    "    \"A completed B.Sc. degree in Mathematics, Industrial Mathematics, Mathematical Economy, Computer Science, Data Science, or Physics from FAU or an equivalent domestic or international degree that aligns with the competence profile of the program. A GPA of 2.5 or better (German grading system) is required. Applicants with a GPA between 2.6 and 2.8 will be invited for an online interview assessing their knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, algorithms, and data structures. English proficiency at B2 CEFR or proof of English-taught education is required.\",\n",

    "    \"Completely in German.\",\n",
    "    \"After receiving your admission letter, you must enroll for the next semester by sending certified documents via postal service to the Student Records Office. The enrollment fee should be transferred in advance, especially if transferring from abroad (recommended two weeks before). After enrollment, you gain access to online teaching resources and platforms like StudOn and Campo.\",\n",
    "    \"No, but solid German knowledge (B1) is recommended for daily life, internships, and working student jobs. However, a certificate is not required for the application.\",\n",
    "    \"You can reapply using your existing Campo account.\",\n",
    "    \"Due to the abolition of the 60 ECTS regulation from the winter semester 2022/23, the examination regulations of the Data Science program changed. The letter of admission from winter semester 2021/22 will no longer be recognized. Your application will be completely re-examined and re-evaluated, so uploading the previous offer letter makes no difference.\",\n",
    "    \"As you found on Campo, the seminar can be counted as a Master Seminar.\",\n",
    "    \"This course is not recognized for the MSc Data Science study program. Therefore, even if you attend this course, you will not be able to accredit any ECTS.\",\n",
    "    \"To complete your degree, you need 120 ECTS, including all core, major, minor, application modules, seminar, and thesis. If you complete 120 ECTS by September 2024 and your supervisor submits your thesis grade before the end of September, you will be deregistered at the end of the summer semester 2024. If you complete it in October 2024, you will be deregistered at the end of the winter semester 2024/25. You can also choose to de-register earlier if desired.\",\n",
    "    \"1) The duration of one semester is 6 months. 2) There is no restriction on study hours per week. You can take subjects at your comfort, but 30 ECTS per semester is recommended (1 ECTS = 1 hour of study). 3) Yes, you can work part-time. A student can work up to 20 hours per week with a part-time student job.\",\n",
    "    \"The admissions committee evaluates your profile only after you apply via the Campo portal.\",\n",
    "    \"The automatic re-registration for second attempts in examinations is done manually by the examination office.\",\n",
    "    \"I recommend sending a course description for the seminar, including details like the module number and exact name in Campo, to the examination committee and asking if the seminar can be included in one of the module groups of the MSc Data Science program.\",\n",
    "    \"You can complete a 5 ECTS module instead of a 2.5 ECTS module. Just ensure that you meet at least the 2.5 ECTS requirement.\"\n",
